Simple attempts to understand the impact of changing our fantasy baseball league's scoring mechanism. 

We were mostly interested in making relief pitchers more valuable relative to starting pitcher. My findings was that our proposed changes (making holds and saves more valuable) would change the proportion of fringe relief pitchers and fringe starting pitchers to skew a bit more towards the relief pitchers, which was the outcome we were hoping for. I also found that the average impact to each team's weekly score woud be minimal. 

I wanted to scrape ESPN's fantasy pages at first to get the point totals, but I ultimately discovered that it was easier to pull data from baseball-reference.com and just have the values we were interested in testing hard coded. Results were compiled in both R and Python, though to be perfectly honest, I can't remember why. I think it had something to do with how easy it would be to share the charts I created with my leaguemates.
